// forEach question in array questions -> generate new page 
//DONE




// each page gets unique id number for easier navigation. Navigation bar on the left could be added later
//1) Done

// each page's answers are generated in random order and each question has only 1 correct answer which should be declared later. 
//After pressing Answer button, style of the questions should be changed depended on wether you are right or not

// functions goBack and goForward should go to the previous page which should be saved. After each reload of the page all is generated from scratch. Saving could be added later
