# Examination Website

This is a simple one-page examination website designed to help you understand the basics of web development, primarily using JavaScript. The website offers two types of tests: casual and real exams.

## Features

- **Casual Test:** Contains fun questions with images and audio for entertainment.
- **Real Test:** A more serious exam with 13 questions to be answered within 3 minutes.

## How to Start

1. Choose between the casual or real test.
2. For each question, you can:
   - Answer the question.
   - Observe the submit button animation.
   - Check the correctness of your answer visually (red for wrong, green for correct).
   - Use the sidebar on the left to navigate through questions.
3. You can also go back and forth during the test.

## How to See Results

To view your results, you have three options:

1. Wait until the timer ends. A pop-up message will display your results automatically.
2. Answer all questions, and the results will be shown automatically.
3. Click the "Hand in" button in the header to finish the test before the time ends. Confirm your submission, and your score will be calculated.
